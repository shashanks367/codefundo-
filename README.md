Microsoft Codeftundo++ Global Disaster Prediction

Our goal is to tackle global disasters by predicting rainfall and the flood-affected areas. We'll implement this by using Android App to keep track of locations, and supervising the management team in a better way. 

We are considering  different weather parameters in different areas  which  we will obtain from Google or other APIs. By using the predicted values of rainfall, we will foresee the most affected areas in the flood's vicinity, and hence we will predict the havoc which could be caused by heavy rainfall in particular areas.We will also take into account the rainfall records of previous years, and gauge the impact of the flood.  Lastly, we will try to implement this idea on an Android App using GPS, and hence obtain the corresponding longitudes and latitudes which will be fed to the respective APIs. Furthermore, we will use Google Maps to display the most affected areas in terms of severity of danger.

This app could be used by authorities to deploy management teams to local areas to evacuate people to safe places. It could also be used to be aware of the upcoming disaster, for communication and supervision of the management team.
