Microsoft Codeftundo++ global disaster prediction
In order to tackle global disasters, for prediction of rainfall we are mainly considering  different weather parameters in different areas  which  we can easily get from various APIs. By using the predicted values of rainfall, we can foresee the most affected areas in the flood's vicinity, and hence we can predict the havoc which could be caused by heavy rainfall in particular areas and deploy management teams to local areas to evacuate people to safe places. We will also take into account the rainfall records of previous years, and gauge the impact of the flood.  Lastly, if time permits we will try to implement this idea on an android app using Google map for location and supervising the management of foreseen destruction in a better way.
